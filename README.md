Explore Bike Share Data
Our data is about bike share system where data consists of info about trips taken by service's members, their types, their age, their gender, stations of starting and ending trips, duration of trips etc. The data consisted of trip duration and attributes of approximately 180000 member data. of info about trips taken by service's members, their types, their age, their gender, stations of starting and ending trips, duration of trips etc.I also developped new variables column from the provided start and end time of the trips those columns contain the day of the week which the trip done in also the part of day. My findings:
> Duration a lot of trips takes less than 1000 second. When plotted on a log-scale, the duration distribution looks unimodal, with one peak between 500 and 1000. > In other words, most trips are short and do not exceed 15 minutes >as the number of the unique values of the start station name is so large to be plotted in one plot i will use the value_counts to only plot the top 50 stations and there was some dominant start and stop stations and we will do further explorations in the following steps
>the distribution of the year of birth shows to be right skewed with a right tail and it also shows that their ore couple of outliers with un realstic values that needs to be cleaned and after that it shows that most users birth year falls between 1980 and 2000 In other words youth people >from the member gender plotting it is obviously that most of the users are male with huge difference
> by plotting the user type column it again a clear observation that most of the user type are subscriber
> by plotting the day of the week column it shows that the start of trips is the least during weekend
> by plotting the part of day column I found that most trips start and end during noon and morning part of day
By using bivariate visualizations I found that:  the average trip duration increase in customer type and in the female users than the subscriber and males users recpectively  duration of the trip does not differ significally with the change of the gender  duration of the trip range increase in the late night trips  duration of the trip does not differ significally with the change of the day except for saturday trips  the average age for both the male and female users are close and also for the both user types
